# Requirements to Successfully run the Backend Server

1. Install Dependencies:
    - Run npm install in the root directory not in backend directory

2. Environment Variables:
    - Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.
    - Open the .env file in a text editor.

3. Create the following environment variables in the .env file based on your mysql configurations.
    - MYSQL_HOST: Your MySQL server hostname or IP address
    - MYSQL_USER: Your MySQL username
    - MYSQL_PASSWORD: Your MySQL password
    - MYSQL_DB: The name of the MySQL database
4. Port configuration:
    - Set the PORT environment variable in the `.env` file to specify the server port.
     ```
     PORT=3000
     ```
   - You can replace "3000" with your desired port number.

5. Start the Backend Server:
   - In your terminal, navigate to the project's root directory.
   - Run the following command to start the backend server:
     ```
     npm start
     ```

Access the Backend:
    - Once the server is running, you can access the backend API at the specified PORT (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
