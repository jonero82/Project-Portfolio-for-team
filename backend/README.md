This directory contains all backend code for the project.

# Backend Folder

The `backend/` directory contains all the backend-related code and configurations for our project. This is where the server-side logic and functionality are implemented to handle HTTP requests, manage data, and serve as the backend for our application.

## Contents

Here's an overview of what you'll find inside the `backend/` directory:

### 1. `src/`

The `src/` directory is the core of our backend application. It includes the following components:

- **`index.js`**: This is the main entry point of our backend server. It initializes and starts the server, setting up routes and middleware.

- **`routes/`**: This directory contains route handlers for our API endpoints. Each route file corresponds to a specific API route, defining how the server responds to incoming requests.

- **`controllers/`**: Backend controllers are responsible for handling business logic. They process data, interact with models, and formulate responses to client requests.

- **`models/`**: Data models represent the structure of our application's data. They interact with the database and provide an abstraction layer for working with data.

### 2. `config/`

The `config/` directory holds configuration files for our backend application. Key configurations can include settings for the database, environment variables, and any other backend-specific settings.
